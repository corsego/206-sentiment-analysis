Ruby on Rails: Learn 25+ gems and build a Startup MVP 2023,David C,2024-10-16 03:43:51+00:00,4.0,"The course was outdated; most of the things didn’t work as expected. I had to make a lot of changes to get the project running. Additionally, the teacher didn’t explain what he was doing in some chapters and assumed that the students already knew how to proceed. I had to rely on external resources and search elsewhere because the information provided wasn’t very helpful. However, some of the tools were useful and contained many gems that I didn’t know about."
